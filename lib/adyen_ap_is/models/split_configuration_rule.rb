    # s/(merchantId)/splitConfigurations#request-rules-splitLogic) applies to
    # the transaction.
    # > This condition is in pilot phase, and not yet available for all
    # platforms.
    # Possible values:
    # * **domestic**: The card issuer and the store where the transaction is
    # processed are registered in the same country.
    # * **international**: The card issuer and the store where the transaction
    # is processed are registered in different countries or regions. Includes
    # all **interRegional** and **intraRegional** transactions.
    # * **interRegional**: The card issuer and the store where the transaction
    # is processed are registered in different regions.
    # * **intraRegional**: The card issuer and the store where the transaction
    # is processed are registered in different countries, but in the same
    # region.
    # * **ANY**: Applies to all transactions, regardless of the processing and
    # issuing country/region.

    # * [Payment method
    # variant](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/paymentmethodvariant
    # ): Apply the split logic for a specific payment method.
    # * **ANY**: Apply the split logic for all available payment methods.

    # Possible values:
    # * **Ecommerce**: Online transactions where the cardholder is present.
    # * **ContAuth**: Card on file and/or subscription transactions, where the
    # cardholder is known to the merchant (returning customer).
    # * **Moto**: Mail-order and telephone-order transactions where the customer
    # is in contact with the merchant via email or telephone.
    # * **POS**: Point-of-sale transactions where the customer is physically
    # present to make a payment using a secure payment terminal.
    # * **ANY**: All sales channels.
