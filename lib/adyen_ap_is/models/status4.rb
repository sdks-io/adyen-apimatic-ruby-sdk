  # The status of the session. The status included in the response doesn't get
  # updated. Don't make the request again to check for payment status updates.
  # Possible values: * **completed**: the shopper completed the payment, and the
  # payment was authorized. * **paymentPending**: the shopper is in the process
  # of making the payment. This applies to payment methods with an asynchronous
  # flow, like voucher payments where the shopper completes the payment in a
  # physical shop. * **refused**: the session has been refused, because of too
  # many refused payment attempts. The shopper can no longer complete the
  # payment with this session. * **canceled**: the shopper canceled the payment.
  # * **expired**: the session expired. The shopper can no longer complete the
  # payment with this session. By default, the session expires one hour after it
  # is created.
