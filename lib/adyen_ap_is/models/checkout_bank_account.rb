    # The name of the bank account holder.
    # If you submit a name with non-Latin characters, we automatically replace
    # some of them with corresponding Latin characters to meet the FATF
    # recommendations. For example:
    # * χ12 is converted to ch12.
    # * üA is converted to euA.
    # * Peter Møller is converted to Peter Mller, because banks don't accept
    # 'ø'.
    # After replacement, the ownerName must have at least three alphanumeric
    # characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), and at least one of them must be a valid Latin
    # character (A-Z, a-z). For example:
    # * John17 - allowed.
    # * J17 - allowed.
    # * 171 - not allowed.
    # * John-7 - allowed.
