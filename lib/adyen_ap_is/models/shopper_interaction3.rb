module AdyenApIs
  # Specifies the sales channel, through which the shopper gives their card
  # details, and whether the shopper is a returning customer. For the web
  # service API, Adyen assumes Ecommerce shopper interaction by default. This
  # field has the following possible values: * `Ecommerce` - Online transactions
  # where the cardholder is present (online). For better authorization rates, we
  # recommend sending the card security code (CSC) along with the request. *
  # `ContAuth` - Card on file and/or subscription transactions, where the
  # cardholder is known to the merchant (returning customer). If the shopper is
  # present (online), you can supply also the CSC to improve authorization
  # (one-click payment). * `Moto` - Mail-order and telephone-order transactions
  # where the shopper is in contact with the merchant via email or telephone. *
  # `POS` - Point-of-sale transactions where the shopper is physically present
  # to make a payment using a secure payment terminal.
