module AdyenApIs
  # Indicates the status of the SIM card in the payment terminal. Can be updated
  # and received only at terminal level, and only for models that support
  # cellular connectivity. Possible values: * **ACTIVATED**: the SIM card is
  # activated. Cellular connectivity may still need to be enabled on the
  # terminal itself, in the **Network** settings. * **INVENTORY**: the SIM card
  # is not activated. The terminal can't use cellular connectivity.
