  # The result of the payment. For more information, see [Result
  # codes](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/payment-result-codes).
  # Possible values: * **AuthenticationFinished** – The payment has been
  # successfully authenticated with 3D Secure 2. Returned for 3D Secure 2
  # authentication-only transactions. * **AuthenticationNotRequired** – The
  # transaction does not require 3D Secure authentication. Returned for
  # [standalone authentication-only
  # integrations](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/3d-secure/other-3ds-flo
  # ws/authentication-only). * **Authorised** – The payment was successfully
  # authorised. This state serves as an indicator to proceed with the delivery
  # of goods and services. This is a final state. * **Cancelled** – Indicates
  # the payment has been cancelled (either by the shopper or the merchant)
  # before processing was completed. This is a final state. *
  # **ChallengeShopper** – The issuer requires further shopper interaction
  # before the payment can be authenticated. Returned for 3D Secure 2
  # transactions. * **Error** – There was an error when the payment was being
  # processed. The reason is given in the `refusalReason` field. This is a final
  # state. * **IdentifyShopper** – The issuer requires the shopper's device
  # fingerprint before the payment can be authenticated. Returned for 3D Secure
  # 2 transactions. * **PartiallyAuthorised** – The payment has been authorised
  # for a partial amount. This happens for card payments when the merchant
  # supports Partial Authorisations and the cardholder has insufficient funds. *
  # **Pending** – Indicates that it is not possible to obtain the final status
  # of the payment. This can happen if the systems providing final status
  # information for the payment are unavailable, or if the shopper needs to take
  # further action to complete the payment. * **PresentToShopper** – Indicates
  # that the response contains additional information that you need to present
  # to a shopper, so that they can use it to complete a payment. * **Received**
  # – Indicates the payment has successfully been received by Adyen, and will be
  # processed. This is the initial state for all payments. * **RedirectShopper**
  # – Indicates the shopper should be redirected to an external web page or app
  # to complete the authorisation. * **Refused** – Indicates the payment was
  # refused. The reason is given in the `refusalReason` field. This is a final
  # state.
