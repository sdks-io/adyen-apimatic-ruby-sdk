  # The result of the payment. For more information, see [Result
  # codes](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/payment-result-codes).
  # Possible values: * **Authorised** – The payment was successfully authorised.
  # This state serves as an indicator to proceed with the delivery of goods and
  # services. This is a final state. * **Received** – Indicates the payment
  # request was successfully received by Adyen, and will be processed. This is
  # the initial state for all payments. * **Pending** – The payment order was
  # successfully received but the final status of the payment is not available
  # yet. This is common for payment methods with an asynchronous flow.
